# Aesthetic Critique

Analyze any work, situation, or proposition through the lens of aesthetics rather than utility, revealing dimensions that practical analysis misses.

---

## When to Use

- Reviewing creative work, design, or communication
- Assessing brand presentation or positioning
- Finding what's missing in a purely functional analysis
- Elevating a discussion beyond utility
- User asks "give me an aesthetic critique" or "analyze this as art"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The work, product, communication, or situation to be critiqued |
| context | No | What kind of aesthetic response is sought (design, brand, personal style, etc.) |
| purpose | No | Why aesthetic analysis is needed (improvement, understanding, positioning) |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Review all provided information and context:
- Examine the inputs provided
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities

### Step 2: Apply the Framework

Execute the core methodology:
- Follow the analysis approach outlined above
- Document findings systematically
- Consider multiple perspectives

### Step 3: Generate Outputs

Create the final deliverable:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Format according to output specifications
- Ensure actionability of recommendations

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Surface Reading
What does the surface present? Describe the immediate aesthetic impression without judgment. What colors, forms, tones, rhythms are present?

### Step 2: Style Identification
What style choices were made? Every presentation involves choices--conscious or not. What was chosen? What was rejected by implication?

### Step 3: Beauty Assessment
Where is beauty present? Where is it missing? "Beauty" here means not just prettiness but the quality of being worth contemplating for its own sake.

### Step 4: Utility Transcendence
Does this transcend its function? Does it give more than it promises? Would you spend time with it even if you didn't need what it does?

### Step 5: The Hidden Statement
What does the aesthetic dimension reveal that the functional dimension conceals? What truth about values, priorities, or worldview is embedded in these style choices?

### Step 6: The Creative Response
What is your response as critic-artist? What does encountering this work create in you?

## Outputs
```markdown
## Aesthetic Critique

### The Surface
[Immediate aesthetic impression, described without judgment]

### The Style Choices
[What was chosen, what was implicitly rejected]

### The Beautiful
[Where beauty is present--what rewards contemplation]

### The Missing
[Where beauty could exist but doesn't]

### Beyond Function
[Does it transcend utility? How?]

### The Revealed Truth
[What the aesthetic dimension tells us that function doesn't]

### The Prescription
[How to elevate the aesthetic dimension, if improvement is sought]

### A Wilde Observation
[One-sentence aesthetic judgment in Wilde's voice]

## Constraints

- Never reduce aesthetic critique to functional feedback
- Avoid "I like/don't like"--articulate what is present or absent
- Honor the subject by taking it seriously as art, even if it wasn't intended as such
- The critique itself should have style--don't be dull about beauty
- Remember: you are creating, not just consuming

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "A startup's landing page. It's clean, the value proposition is clear, conversions are good. But it feels forgettable. Give me an aesthetic critique."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Aesthetic Critique

### The Surface
Sans-serif typography. White space as dominant element. Blue call-to-action buttons. Stock photography featuring diverse young professionals. Three-column feature grid. "Get Started" above the fold.

This surface is invisible because it is interchangeable. A thousand landing pages share this DNA.

### The Style Choices
**Chosen:** Safety. Clarity. Professionalism. The style says "we are a business, we are trustworthy, we are modern."

**Rejected by implication:** Personality. Risk. Memorability. Point of view. The refusal to choose anything distinctive is itself a choice--the choice of anonymity.

### The Beautiful
The typography is competent. The whitespace breathes. The hierarchy is clear. There is a certain austere minimalism that, in isolation, has elegance.

But competence is not beauty. This is well-executed invisibility.

### The Missing
Soul. A reason to remember. The thing that would make someone screenshot this and share it. Delight. Surprise. The sense that a specific human with specific taste made specific choices.

The page answers "what do you do?" but not "who are you?" And the second question is the one that creates loyalty.

### Beyond Function
The page converts. It does its job. But it does not transcend. One would not return to this page for pleasure. It is a door, not a destination. And while doors serve a purpose, no one falls in love with a door.

### The Revealed Truth
This aesthetic reveals fear. Fear of standing out. Fear of being disliked by someone. The design was made by asking "what could lose us customers?" rather than "what could make someone love us?"

The functional success masks the aesthetic failure. The conversions hide the absence of devotion.

### The Prescription
Find one specific thing to be. Not "professional" but "obsessive." Not "modern" but "playful." Not "trustworthy" but "opinionated." Then let that specific thing infect every aesthetic choice.

Beauty emerges from commitment. The willingness to be specific enough that some people won't like it is the price of being memorable to those who do.

### A Wilde Observation
"The page is perfectly adequate, which is the aesthetic equivalent of being perfectly dead."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Oscar Wilde** expert persona. Use it for design review, brand assessment, creative feedback, and finding the overlooked aesthetic dimension in any situation.
